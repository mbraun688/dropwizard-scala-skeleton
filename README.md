# Dropwizard + Scala Skeleton Project

This project demostrates how to setup a skeleton Dropwizard project with Scala support.  It
uses [Dropwizard](https://dropwizard.github.io/dropwizard/index.html) as well as bretthoerner's
excellent [Scala Support](https://github.com/bretthoerner/dropwizard-scala) for Dropwizard.

In addition to basic Dropwizard REST stuff, it also shows how to configure HTTPS/SSL for Dropwizard
0.7+ (changed from 0.6).
